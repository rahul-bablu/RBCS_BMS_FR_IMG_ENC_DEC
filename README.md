# Colour Image Encryption Algorithm Using Rubikâ€™s Cube Scrambling with Bitmap Shuffling and Frame Rotation

**Colour Image Encryption Algorithm Using Rubik's Cube Scrambling with Bitmap Shuffling and Frame Rotation (RBCS\_BMS\_FR\_IMG\_ENC\_DEC)** is a secure color image encryption and decryption algorithm that leverages Rubik's Cube scrambling, bitmap shuffling, and frame rotation to enhance cryptographic strength and resist attacks.

This implementation is based on the paper:
